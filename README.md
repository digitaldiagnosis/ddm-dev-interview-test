# Front End Coding Challenge

ACME Marketing is designing a new social networking site and needs your help coding a widget. A designer has already come up with a design, but we still need your help turning that design into code.

## Requirements:

*   You can see how the widget should look like by going to the assets folder. The image is called profile-widget.png
*   Use the provided image as the profile image. Use CSS to format it. Don't use an image editing software.
*   Demonstrate use of web standards including HTML5.
*   Use your preferred CSS framework or custom CSS.
*   Use the "Roboto" Google font
*   Use CSS to hide the FOLLOW button on mobile screens.
*   If the FOLLOW button is clicked, display a box under the buttons with this message: "You are now following Marcus Doe!"
*   If the MESSAGE button is clicked, display a modal window with this message: "This feature is not implemented yet!". There should be a way to cancel out of the modal window.
*   Bonus point: Use CSS animation with transition to make the buttons fade into the screen on the initial load.
